# MarcoEngine

*Marco Engine* - interesnaya neyronnaya shakhmatnaya set', kotoraya ispol'zuyet metod samoobucheniya(dostizheniye khoroshoy igy putem proboy oshibok). Tekhnicheski, yeye reyting - **3320**. Khotya, my uvereny, chto eto ne maksimal'nyy reyting.

Marco Engine is an interesting neural chess network that uses a self-learning method (achieving a good game by trying out mistakes). Technically, her rating is **3320**. Although, we are sure that this is not the maximum rating.

# Objective of the project

The goal of the **MarcoEngine** project is to create new self-learning algorithms. After that, on the scales that we get, we can make an almost perfect game for all possible moves.
