*Marco Engine* - Marco Engine is an interesting neural chess network that uses a self-learning method (achieving a good game by trying out mistakes). Technically, her rating is **3320**. Although, we are sure that this is not the maximum rating.

# Objective of the project

The goal of the **MarcoEngine** project is to create new self-learning algorithms. After that, on the weights that we get, we can make an almost perfect game for all possible moves.
